Input: instructions = "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.

Input: instructions = "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves north indefinitely.

Input: instructions = "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...

We do not need to run 4 cycles to identify the limit cycle trajectory. One cycle is enough. There could be two situations here.

  1. First, if the robot returns to the initial point after one cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.
  2. Second, if the robot doesn't face north at the end of the first cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory. Once again, that's the consequence of the plane symmetry for the repeated cycles [proof].
